# Contributing to FTTV
VS Code is the recommended editor - but feel free to use whatever you are familiar with.

## Build
To start up the development server, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## PRs
Before submitting a PR, make sure you run `npm run lint` and fix all errors.

Some errors may have auto-fixes, in which case you can run `npm run lint -- --fix` and fix the remaining errors.

For the title of your PR, put a descriptive summary of what you changed.

If needed, you can expand on the title in the PR description.
